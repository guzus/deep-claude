# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 15: Description of SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md file
- Before: "A `SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md` file acts as a relay baton, passing context and next steps between iterations"
- After: "A `SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md` file maintains continuity by passing context between iterations, enabling seamless handoffs across AI and human developers"
- Key change: More specific about the value (continuity, handoffs) and explicitly mentions both AI and human developers

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific about what each example demonstrates
- Lines 34-39: Flag descriptions could include more context about when/why to use each option
- Line 19: "Prerequisites: Install and authenticate..." could be broken into clearer steps
